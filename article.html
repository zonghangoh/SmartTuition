    <h2> 7 Ways to Memorize and Learn things faster</h2>
    <p class='lead'> 1 November 2021</p>

    <p> Struggling to remember the content taught in class? Having difficulty in grasping and learning new concepts?
      Follow
      these methods to learn effectively and boost your memory.</p>


    <h4>Exercise</h4>
    <p>
      Exercising reaps many benefits, from ensuring your physical health to mental well-being. Not only that, it can
      help
      to boost your memory and thinking skills by increasing blood flow and oxygen transported to the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      An article by Harvard Medical School suggests that working out can enhance cognitive function, allowing you to
      increase attention span and retain information better. If you are always unable to concentrate during lessons or
      recall what was taught in class, try squeezing in a short workout routine in your schedule and you will be
      surprised
      by the results.
    </p>

    <h4>Write Your Own Notes</h4>
    <p>
      Taking down notes forces you to focus in class and process information more detailedly, aiding you in grasping the
      concepts taught more easily. Writing the content increases the degree of attention to the text and involves deeper
      cognitive-processing, allowing information to be loaded into your memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A level up to making your notes will be to create mind maps for each of the topics that you are learning. This
      helps
      to:
      Establish linkages between the concepts, further enhancing your understanding on the topics.
      Combining text with visual elements would also improve information retention, converting them from short-term to
      long-term memory.
    </p>

    <h4>Practice, Practice and Practice</h4>
    <p>
      It is an age-old saying that “Practice makes perfect”. When students practice solving questions, their ability to
      transfer practiced skills to new and more complex problems is enhanced. However, how much practice is actually
      considered enough to make it perfect?
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important that students do not overkill with practice. Our Super App identifies your area of weakness and
      curates practice questions(INTERNAL LINK), allowing you to focus on drilling your foundation in areas that your
      learning outcomes are not met. With the progress report updated every time our students complete a practice,
      students can know when they have practiced enough, saving them the time and energy.
    </p>


    <h4>Use Mnemonics Devices</h4>
    <p>
      Mnemonic is a tool that helps us to remember large amounts of information quickly for the long-term. It can come
      in
      many forms, such as acronyms, songs and rhymes, and is extremely useful when the order of information is
      important.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little effort and some creative juices are needed to come up with the list, but you can retain the information
      for
      a much longer period of time compared to purely memorising the words in order.
    </p>

    <h4>Reflect And Review Your Progress</h4>
    <p>
      Reflecting on what has been learned makes learning more self-aware and productive. Effectively reviewing our
      progress builds one's confidence in the ability to achieve a goal (self-efficacy) translates into higher rates of
      learning. It is important that we assess whether we have achieved the learning goals of a particular topic, rather
      than cramming practices blindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Super App aims to help students assess whether the learning outcomes have been ticked off. The AI algorithm
      effectively assesses our students’ understanding of the learning outcomes and rounds up the progress accurately in
      our weekly progress reports. This saves time and effort for both our tutors and students who are looking to track
      their progress of understanding on the road to examinations!
    </p>

    <h4>Use The Power Of Mental Spacing</h4>
    <p>
      One of the most effective strategies in retaining information is the idea of “distributed practice” and
      “interleaving”— spacing out your study session over brief, frequent sessions, rather than long, marathon sessions
      and alternating between different concepts. By Benedict Carey, it is akin to watering a lawn, “You can water a
      lawn
      once a week for 90 minutes or three times a week for 30 minutes,” but “Spacing out the watering during the week
      will
      keep the lawn greener over time.”</p>
    <p>
      To learn effectively, weave in the idea of mental spacing into your schedule.
      Distribute by setting aside spacing out short, regular sessions for each subject everyday, instead of cramming
      overnight.
      Interleave by mixing or alternating concepts that you want to drill into memory. On top of topical practices,
      inter-topical questions or exam-based questions are highly effective in training us to draw concepts from
      different
      topics and apply them.
    </p>


    <p>
      Smart Tuition’s Super App heeds the best practices and aims to train our students’ cognitive abilities with such
      practices. The curated questions generated often mix different concepts across topics in a single set of
      questions,
      in order to strengthen your association between topics.

    </p>

    <h4>Teach Others What You Have Learnt</h4>
    <p>
      The learning-by-teaching approach has been proven to be more effective than re-studying, because it compels the
      teacher to retrieve what they’ve previously studied.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p> Start off by learning the material as if you’re going to teach it to others. Familiarise the concept well enough
      that you are able to explain it in your own words and find answers to likely questions people might ask. Next,
      pretend that you’re teaching the material to someone, it can be anyone, your siblings, your parents and even your
      friends. Did you truly grasp the concept?</p>
    <p> Super App’s discussion forum aims to provide a platform for our students to do just that. Test your true
      understanding of the concept by explaining the questions your friends might have on the forum. Or you’ve got a
      question yourself? Get a friend’s help on our forum. We foster a collaborative learning environment for everybody.
    </p>
